# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kelvin

I'm a Software Engineer based out of Belfast, Northern Ireland.

I got into the Software industry because I loved my Windows Phone 8 and wanted to learn how to make apps. Sadly, it was too late to make a difference so I've done my best to make the most of Native Android & iOS apps across sports, biometrics, marketing, lifestyle and most recently the healthcare industry.
