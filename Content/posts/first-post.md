# First Post - Round 2

In 2022, I thought it would be a good idea to blog about my experience as a software engineer working across Android, iOS and anything new that would take my fancy.

It didn't go well! üòã I made three blog posts hosted on GitHub Pages, down to laziness and thinking, "What do I know compared to others?" I stopped. In December 2023, NameSilo notified me that kelvinharron.com was due to expire, so I figured I would try again.

### Why not Medium?

When I see a Medium article, I scroll down and expect to be paying for the access. I am okay with paying for subscriptions, but the content quality on Medium has been hit-and-miss for me over the years, and I know folks in the industry with 'strong' and less kind opinions on anything Medium.

My next post will discuss how I migrated from Jekyll and GitHub Pages to John Sundell's Published and Netlify hosting. ü§ù
